## Top 10 Words used in each Triology
The translation of the Top 10 Chinese words are plotted on the left, the English words are on the right.
The original words can be seen in the [Occurence dataset](https://github.com/kli486/ThreeBodyProblem_Sentiment_Analysis/blob/main/DataSet/Occurence.csv)

Each of the triology has a few main characters, this is reflected in our plot and is the same for both language. The other nouns could be understand as some important words for the novel, since this is a science fiction, the high frequency of 'space' or 'sun' becomes pretty normal.

We would be able to visualize one interesting difference: In Chinese, the full name are often written together where in English most of the time only part of the name is used to refererence to the character. This means that if there are multiple characters in the fiction with the same last name, their appearance might be added together.
