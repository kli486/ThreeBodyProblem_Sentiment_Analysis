I am conflicted about that but at the same time it might be a good way to keep the book readers on their toes. <br>At least they seem to be keeping the main story the same which is what matters. The scene with all the warriors and horses being pulled to the sky just makes me smile as I can't wait for people to actually see what was going on before that happened.

If the ending of this is as bad as the ending of GoT, I'm gonna have to skip this.  There's only one thing that gives me hope - that they have a completed trilogy to base off of.  In GoT, as long as there was material from George R.R. Martin to base off of, those parts were great.  I hope the same thing applies there, but all the way through to the finish.  Hopefully there's not sections too dark to be watchable without high end TV's too."

(And I've been reading Sci-Fi my whole life).  It reminds me of Asimov.  Lots of great ideas. Very meh writing and characters.  The beginning with the Chinese Cultural Revolution was well done and would make an endearing drama... But once the book goes Sci fi it's a bust.  The characters are insanely flat (other than the cop who is one dimensional), the dialog is awful, the plot and motivations makes no sense, the plot holes are insane and anyone who knows anything about science or engineering will not be able to suspend disbelief.    I have no idea how or why this won a Hugo. People keep raving but it feels like the Sci-Fi equivalent to ""Fifty Shades of Grey"".  Insanely popular and not good.   Project Hail Mary, blows 3BP out of the water and it didn't get a Hugo.... Maybe they read the first 60 pages and stopped there?<br><br>I really hope the show can add depth, rationality and personality to an otherwise meh book.

The Three Body Problem is terrifying because (aside from hampering our technological progress and observation) the Trisolarians basically don't (and can't) do anything for a vast majority of the story. These books are about how humanity deals with crisis more than it fights space battles.

If you've read the books, the trailer is amazing and you can place the scenes in the books. Without that, there is no context for this trailer. Netflix is spending hundreds of millions of $ to make this series and will want to have as wide a distribution as possible. I'm afraid that they will make choices to make the show popular rather than sticking to the storyline which the majority of readers want. How do you even make a series on the third book, the weakest of the three in my opinion."

At first I thought this was all secret government documents until I found this is a book series. Never read a book nor had any interest in reading a book in all my 34 years. After hearing his breakdowns of the book series I was so intrigued I got them on audio and just yesterday found physical copies at barns n Noble and bought them. I'm addicted to this series I can't wait to get through the audio series. This show is my most anticipated shows of all time now. Can't wait to watch this. Hope it stays true to the books. My only regret? That I am not apart of the new show lol. Thank you Quinn's ideas for me discovering such an amazing book series.

There's a small stream that's very close to this one 2 story cabin structure. Mostly made of slightly brittle wood. My sight thinks the stream should be a little dirty. The stream ends towards a small strip of beach. Very close is a port. Just recently one of the unit on that wooden building had some sort of odd shrine. It was dedicated to American pornstars. One wall had portraits that look like family photos. But they were all American pornstars. Tried to look around one small wall, but it looked like someone artificially built it. Closing off a small room. There was 3 to 4 other people walking with me into that unit. We ended up in the master bedroom. All the room were empty except the livingroom with portraits hanging on the wall. Bedroom window was close to the stream. People were fishing in the semi dirty stream that led to the beach"

They have Wade as a character who doesnt even show up until after the first book. And Sophon as well. So they will probably bleed some of the concepts from the first two books.

Out of all the Sci-Fi books out there, the out of the box thinking all the crazy ideas people come up with to interest you into reading their book, the three body problem is on a completely different level. The second that you thought Syfy couldn't get any more insane then comes the three body problem. This is beyond Syfy because it's just so incredibly intelligent and smart. If a savant was a book it would be the three body problem. I love that they're making this into a series but to be honest with you, there is no television series, director or CGI that is going to give this series Justice. It's just too big for the big screen to give it the Justice it deserves."

Let it grow and gain popularity by word of mouth like Stranger Things and don't cancel it early for god's sake. Also, writing. Effects don't make an amazing show (they add to it), the writing does (and the acting of that script). Please don't make the mistake so many other adaptations have that fail to follow the source material (Amazon's LotR, your own The Witcher series...). Do these simple things and this could be up there with Dark and Stranger Things as the best you've done. Also, what a travesty you canceled 1899. It's why it's hard to trust any streaming show anymore."

Now, I‚Äôm a newer fan, having only discovered Liu‚Äôs body of work about a year ago but I was instantly captivated and dove in head first. It started with the first Wandering Earth movie which really piqued my interest, then I discovered much of his work including works of short fiction has been adapted in graphic novel format so I quickly consumed The Devourer, Butterfly, and Village Teacher. Finally I got into the novels, starting with the Remembrance(Three Body) trilogy.

However, they do seem to shine when they're adapting someone else's work rather than writing new material. <br><br>I don't think the trailer makes it look very good - doesn't really show the plot, and shows a confusing amount of timelines. I look forward to the show because I've wanted to read the books but hope they make a better trailer.<br><br>Also, single-digit numbers are normally written out. How the title of this show got through so many people and not once did someone correct it to, ""Three-Body Problem,"" is beyond me - especially because the novel is, ""The Three-Body Problem""! The name of the show has two grammatical errors, sounds like D&D's typical quality control."

When I heard there would be a Netflix adaptation I was honstely so scared because most of their shows are at a much lower budget than something HBO or Amazon would make.

The Chinese Series was, despite faults (slow at times eg. episode 8-10), true to the book and clearly made by people who love it. It appears that the Wang Miao character is a woman in this trailer (it remains to be seen if that is correct) . If this is true how can it be true to the book?

You cannot ask people who know mathematics which actually deals in proof, truth and falsity to suspend disbelief over such a basic fact of your story.<br><br>So over and over I ran into the plot point and I just got more and more disgusted. Did the author just not know? Did he never bother to actually check? It isn't even material to the plot as when they finally describe the alien's situation it isn't actually a 3 body or n body problem at all, I get the author isn't a geometer or a physicist but do some research before writing for crying out loud."

I hope more than anything they actually commit to three seasons, covering each book. Seeing Sophon is concerning, but I could understand how she may have just been placed in the simulation that the Three Body Problem was to begin with. It could make sense given what the simulation was. But I‚Äôm terrified to think that they spent this much time and effort into making the trilogy into a 10-episode miniseries. That just cannot work. The Dark Forest may just be the greatest singular sci-fi book of all time, and it NEEDS its own season to develop it. Please Netflix, we‚Äôre begging you, don‚Äôt give up on this.

It's basically game theory mentality elevated to cosmic proportions, which is super intriguing (yes, I devoured the books), but also very ideologically biased, scientifically all over the place, and kind of effed up in a personal level. I'm not saying it's propaganda, but I learned to distrust anyone who makes claims and political stances basen on a suposed ""human nature"", let alone an ""any-inteligent-life-in-the-cosmos nature"".

That's a crazy amount of money considering the series doesn't go full sci-fi until Dark Forest and Death's End. Book 1 is actually more of a psychological thriller. That means they may need to spend more if they plan to adapt the entire trilogy.

So I kind of scare if Netflix would destroy charaterÔºåthey would definitely lose the market in china if they do soÔºåbut I wonder if the chinese audience is even thier primary target.

But when I heard it was getting made in to a show, I thought to myself ""how could they make a show from this? It's literally unfilmable?"" Hope I'm wrong, but the book is too crazy and insane to make into a show that reflects what we read in the book. <br><br>The 3rd book especially is so far beyond visual expression that I just can't see it. What's described in this book just goes beyond what any visual medium can really show us.
