1,她挥舞着战旗，挥动着自己燃烧的青春，敌人将在这火焰中化为灰烬，理想世界明天就会在她那沸腾的热血中诞生……,"She waved the battle banner as though brandishing her burning youth, trusting that the enemy would be burnt to ashes in the revolutionary flames, imagining that an ideal world would be born tomorrow from the ardor and zeal coursing through her blood.… ",1,1
2,她陶醉在这鲜红灿烂的梦幻中，直到被一颗步枪子弹洞穿了胸膛，十五岁少女的胸膛是那么柔嫩，那颗子弹穿过后基本上没有减速，在她身后的空中发出一声啾鸣。年轻的红卫兵同她的旗帜一起从楼顶落下，她那轻盈的身体落得甚至比旗帜还慢，仿佛小鸟眷恋着天空,"She was intoxicated by her brilliant, crimson dream until a bullet pierced her chest. Her fifteen-year-old body was so soft that the bullet hardly slowed down as it passed through it and whistled in the air behind her. The young Red Guard tumbled down along with her flag, her light form descending even more slowly than the piece of red fabric, like a little bird unwilling to leave the sky.",-1,-1
3,你父亲在回忆这件事后，对我发出这样的感叹：在中国，任何超脱飞扬的思想都会砰然坠地的，现实的引力太沉重了。,"After your father recounted this memory to me, he sighed and said, “In China, any idea that dared to take flight would only crash back to the ground. The gravity of reality is too strong.”",-1,-1
4,也许，人类和邪恶的关系，就是大洋与漂浮于其上的冰山的关系，它们其实是同一种物质组成的巨大水体，冰山之所以被醒目地认出来，只是由于其形态不同而已，而它实质上只不过是这整个巨大水体中极小的一部分……," Is it possible that the relationship between humanity and evil is similar to the relationship between the ocean and an iceberg floating on its surface? Both the ocean and the iceberg are made of the same material. That the iceberg seems separate is only because it is in a different form. In reality, it is but a part of the vast ocean.…

5,在西方的天际，正在云海中下沉的夕阳仿佛被融化了，太阳的血在云海和天空中弥漫开来，映现出一大片壮丽的血红。,"Over the western horizon, the sun that was slowly sinking into the sea of clouds seemed to melt. The ruddy sun dissolved into the clouds and spread over the sky, illuminating a large patch in magnificent, bloody red.",-1,-1
6,这天叶文洁值夜班，这是最孤寂的时刻，在静静的午夜，宇宙向它的聆听者展示着广漠的荒凉。叶文洁最不愿意看的，就是显示器上缓缓移动的那条曲线，那是红岸接收到的宇宙电波的波形，无意义的噪声,"One night, Ye was working the night shift. This was the loneliest time. In the deep silence of midnight, the universe revealed itself to its listeners as a vast desolation. What Ye disliked most was seeing the waves that slowly crawled across the display, a visual record of the meaningless noise Red Coast picked up from space. ",-1,-1
7,叶文洁感到这条无限长的曲线就是宇宙的抽象，一头连着无限的过去，另一头连着无限的未来，中间只有无规律无生命的随机起伏，一个个高低错落的波峰就像一粒粒大小不等的沙子，整条曲线就像是所有沙粒排成行形成的一维沙漠，荒凉寂寥，长得令人无法忍受。,"Ye felt this interminable wave was an abstract view of the universe: one end connected to the endless past, the other to the endless future, and in the middle only the ups and downs of random chance—without life, without pattern, the peaks and valleys at different heights like uneven grains of sand, the whole curve like a one-dimensional desert made of all the grains of sand lined up in a row, lonely, desolate, so long that it was intolerable",-1,-1
8,但今天，当叶文洁扫了一眼波形显示器后，发现有些异样。即使是专业人员，也很难仅凭肉眼看出波形是否携带信息，但叶文洁对宇宙噪声的波形太熟悉了，眼前移动的波形，似乎多了某种说不出来的东西，这条起伏的细线像是有了灵魂,"On this day, however, Ye saw something odd when she glanced at the waveform display. Even experts had a hard time telling with the naked eye whether a waveform carried information. But Ye was so familiar with the noise of the universe that she could tell that the wave that now moved in front of her eyes had something extra. The thin curve, rising and falling, seemed to possess a soul. ",1,1
9,在令她头晕目眩的激动和迷惑中，叶文洁接着译解了第二段信息：这个世界收到了你们的信息。,"Still caught up by the dizzying excitement and confusion, Ye deciphered a second message:This world has received your message.",1,1
10,"我是这个世界的一个和平主义者，我首先收到信息是你们文明的幸运，警告你们： 
不要回答！不要回答！！不要回答！！！ 
","I am a pacifist in this world. It is the luck of your civilization that I am the first to receive your message. I am warning you: Do not answer! Do not answer!! Do not answer!!!
There are tens of millions of stars in your direction.

11,叶文洁不知道，就在这时，地球文明向太空发出的第一声能够被听到的啼鸣，已经以太阳为中心，以光速飞向整个宇宙。恒星级功率的强劲电波，如磅礴的海潮，此时已越过了木星轨道。,"Ye didn’t know that at that moment, the first cry that could be heard in space from civilization on Earth was already spreading out from the sun to the universe at the speed of light. A star-powered radio wave, like a majestic tide, had already crossed the orbit of Jupiter.",1,1
12,这时，在12000兆赫波段上，太阳是银河系中最亮的一颗星。,"Right then, at the frequency of 12,000 MHz, the sun was the brightest star in the entire Milky Way.",0,0
13,我是个小人物，生活在社会最底层，没有人会注意到我，孤独一生，没有地位没有爱情，也没有希望。,"I’m an ordinary man living at the bottom of society. No one would pay any attention to me. My life is spent alone, without wealth, without status, without love, and without hope.",-1,-1
14,如果我能够拯救一个自己爱上的遥远的美丽世界，那这一辈子至少没有白活。," If I can save a distant, beautiful world that I have fallen in love with, then my life has not been wasted.",1,1
15,站在这闪烁的苍穹下，汪淼突然感到宇宙是这么小，小得仅将他一人禁锢于其中。宇宙是一个狭小的心脏或子宫，这弥漫的红光是充满于其中的半透明的血夜，他悬浮于血液中，红光的闪烁周期是不规则的，像是这心脏或子宫不规则地脉动，他从中感受到了一个以人类的智慧永远无法理解的怪异、变态的巨大存在。,"Standing under the flashing dome of the night sky, Wang suddenly felt the universe shrink until it was so small that only he was imprisoned in it. The universe was a cramped heart, and the red light that suffused everything was the translucent blood that filled the organ. Suspended in the blood, he saw that the flickering of the red light was not periodic—the pulsing was irregular. He felt a strange, perverse, immense presence that could never be understood by human intellect.",-1,-1
16,一切都沉寂下来，只有天线在风中发出的混响依旧。叶文洁看着夜空中的鸟群纷纷落回森林中。她再次仰望天线，感觉它像一只向苍穹张开的巨大手掌，拥有一种超凡脱俗的力量。,"All was silent except for the howl of the wind against the antenna. Ye watched as the remaining birds in the flock gradually settled back into the forest. She stared at the antenna and thought it looked like an enormous hand stretched open toward the sky, possessing an ethereal strength.",0,0
17,她向“手掌”对着的夜空看去，并没有看到已被它打击的BN20197F号目标，在稀疏的云缕后面，只有1969年寒冷的星空。,"As she surveyed the night sky, she did not see any target that she thought might be serial number BN20197F. Beyond the wisps of clouds, all she could see were the stars of a cold night in 1969.
",-1,-1
18,汪淼在想象中把那个萦绕在他脑海中的身影叠印到画面上，让她位于山谷的深处，看上去很小很小；这时汪淼惊奇地发现，整个画面苏醒过来，仿佛照片中的世界认出了那个身影，仿佛这一切本来就是为她而存在。,"In his imagination, Wang placed the figure that lingered in his mind at the far end of the valley. Surprisingly, it made the entire scene come alive, as though the world in the photograph recognized that tiny figure and responded to it, as though the whole scene existed for her.",0,0
19,他又依次在想象中将那个身影叠印到另外几幅作品上，有时还将她那双眼睛作为照片上空旷苍穹的背景，那些画面也都苏醒过来，展现出一种汪淼从未想象过的美,"He then imagined her figure in each of his other photographs, sometimes pasting her two eyes into the empty sky over the landscapes. Those images also came alive, achieving a beauty that Wang had never imagined.
",1,1
20,以前，汪淼总觉得自己的摄影作品缺少某种灵魂；现在他知道了，缺的是她。,"Wang had always thought that his photographs lacked some kind of soul. Now he understood that they were missing her.
",-1,-1
21,晴天霹雳，汪淼的大脑一片空白。后来这空白中渐渐有了图像，那是他那些黑白风景照片，照片中的大地没有了她的身影，天空抹去了她的眼睛，那些世界死了。,"Wang was thunderstruck. Gradually, his black-and-white landscapes faded into blankness in his mind. The photographs no longer had her figure in the foreground, and her eyes were wiped from the skies. Those worlds were all dead.",-1,-1
22,“她像一颗星星，总是那么遥远，照到我身上的光也总是冷的。”丁仪走到窗前看着夜空，像在寻找那颗已逝去的星辰。,"“She was like a star, always so distant. Even the light she shone on me was always cold.” Ding walked to one of the windows and looked up at the night sky.",-1,0
23,汪淼绝望地抓起那堆胶卷，像抓着一团纠缠在一起的蛇，又像一团难以挣脱的绞索。,"Desperate, Wang picked up the pile of film rolls, like a tangled nest of snakes, like a bunch of ropes tied into an impossible knot.",-1,-1
24,荒原依旧，但V装具感应服中的压缩机咝咝地启动了，汪淼感到一股逼人的寒气。前方出现了两个行走的人影，在曙光的背景前呈黑色的剪影。,"The plain remained desolate, but now the compressors in the V-suit whirred to life, and Wang could feel gusts of cold air against his body. Before him appeared two walking figures, forming dark silhouettes against the dawn light.",-1,-1
25,周文王和追随者面面相觑，然后一起盯着汪森，好像他是个白痴，“太阳?看太阳怎么能知道时间? 这可是乱纪元。,"King Wen and Follower stared at each other, and then turned as one to gaze at Wang, as though he was an idiot. “The sun? How can the sun tell us the time? We’re in the midst of a Chaotic Era.”

26,岩石的阴影在渐渐缩短，周围的大地像处于白炽状态般刺眼，脚下的冻土迅速融化，由坚硬如铁变成泥泞一片，热浪滚滚。,"The shadow cast by the rock gradually grew shorter and shorter. The earth around them glowed as though on fire. The permafrost beneath them soon melted, the steel-like hard surface turning into a sea of mud, roiled by waves of heat.",-1,-1
27,在落日的余晖中，汪淼看到追随者身上的汗水突然增加了，他很快知道那不是出汗，这人身体内的水分正在被彻底排出，这些水在沙地上形成了几条小小的溪流，追随者的整个躯体如一根熔化的蜡烛在变软变薄……," In the last glow from the sun, already below the horizon, Wang saw water oozing out of Follower’s body. He knew that it was no longer sweat. All the water in his body was being discharged and squeezed out. The water coalesced into a few small rivulets in the mud. His body turned soft and lost its shape like a melting candle.",0,0
28,周文王说着，将追随者变成的软皮拎起来，拍了拍上面的土，放到岩石上将他（它）卷起来，就像卷一只放了气的皮球一般，“在水里泡一会儿，他就会恢复原状活过来，就像泡干蘑菇那样。” ,"King Wen answered. He picked up Follower’s skin, brushed the mud and dust off, laid him out on the rock, and rolled him up like a balloon with its air let out. “He’ll recover soon enough, when we soak him in water. It’s just like soaking dried mushrooms.”",0,0
29,上方的窗口无规律地闪烁起来，不时有一束乱纪元的阳光射进大殿，有时很微弱，如月光一般；有时则十分强烈，投在地上的方形光斑白炽明亮，使所有的火炬黯然失色。," The opening through the ceiling flickered with random lights, and once in a while a ray of sunlight from the Chaotic Era shot into the Great Hall. Sometimes the light was weak, like moonlight. Sometimes the light was very strong, and the incandescent white square cast against the ground glowed so brightly that the torches in the Great Hall paled in comparison.

30,汪淼的心中涌起一股暖流，双眼湿润了，他那颗两天来绷得紧紧的心脏像被放到了柔软的天鹅绒上。,"Wang accepted the box, warmth filling his chest. His eyes moistened. It was as though his heart, stressed almost beyond the breaking point by the last few days, had been placed onto a pile of soft down feathers.",1,1
31,在圣乐的庄严深远中，汪淼再次感到宇宙变小了，变成了一座空旷的教堂，穹顶隐没于背景辐射闪烁的红光中，而他则是这宏伟教堂地板砖缝中的一只小蚂蚁。,"As he listened to the solemn, sacred music, Wang Miao once again felt that the universe had shrunk until it was the size of an empty church. The domed ceiling was hidden by the flashing red light of the background radiation, and he was an ant crawling through the cracks in the floor.",0,0

33,现在除了死后不知是否存在的另一个世界，她最想去的地方就是这样与世隔绝的峰顶了，在这里，她有一种久违的安全感。,"Other than the undiscovered country beyond death from which no one has ever returned, the place she wanted to be the most was this peak, separated from the rest of the world.

36,汪淼不知道自己是怎么回到自己的车上，躺在后座上陷入了无梦的沉睡，感觉时间并不长，但睁开眼睛后，看到太阳已在城市的西边快要落下去了,"Wang Miao had no idea how he got back into his car. He tumbled into the backseat and fell into a dreamless slumber. He didn’t think that he was asleep for long, but when he opened his eyes, the sun was already near the horizon in the west.

38,不，那天太阳出来了，升到了正空，但突然熄灭了。,"No, the sun rose that day as well. It rose to the middle of the sky, and then went out.",-1,-1
39,在那个位置出现了一颗飞星，像是太阳死后的灵魂。,"A flying star appeared in that location, like a soul left behind after the sun died.”",-1,-1
40,汪淼可以清晰地看到太阳表面的细节，火焰的海洋上布满涌浪和旋涡，黑子如幽灵般沿着无规则的路线漂浮，日冕  像金色的长袖懒洋洋地舒展着。," Wang could clearly make out the fine structures on the surface of the sun: eddies and surging waves filling the sea of flames; sunspots floating along random paths like ghosts; the corona lazily spreading out like golden sleeves.

41,他发现工作是一种有效的麻醉剂，投身于其中，就暂时躲开了那噩梦般的困扰。," He found work to be an effective tranquilizer. As long as he was absorbed by it, he was no longer bothered by his nightmarish worries.",1,1
42,一走出纳米中心的大楼，汪淼又被那噩梦的感觉追上了，他觉得布满群星的夜空像一面覆盖一切的放大镜，他自己是镜下的一只赤裸的小虫，无处躲藏。,"As soon as Wang left the Research Center building, the nightmarelike feeling caught up to him. He felt like the starry sky was a magnifying glass that covered the world, and he was a tiny insect below the lens with nowhere to hide.
",-1,-1
43,他又感到了那种难得的温暖。现在，眼前这位历经沧桑变得平静淡泊的老人，和那位无知而无畏的大史，成了他摇摇欲坠的精神世界的两根支柱。," He once again felt the warmth that he had missed. In his current state, his mental stability depended on two pillars: this old woman, who had weathered so many storms and become as gentle as water, and Shi Qiang, the man who feared nothing because he knew nothing.",1,1
44,“说起‘文革’，我还是很幸运的，在活不下去的时候，竟意外地到了一个能活下去的地方。”,"“As far as the Cultural Revolution is concerned, I was pretty lucky. Just when I thought I had nowhere to go, I found a place where I could survive.”

45,于是领导指挥向东，他就卖力气地向西，故意装傻，指望领导产生这样的想法：这人也尽力了，但就这么点能力和水平，留他没什么用，反而碍手碍脚的。,"So if the supervisor said to go east, they would work hard to move west, purposely playing the fool. Their hope was to put the following thought into the supervisor’s head: This man is working hard, but he’s limited in his skills. There’s no point in keeping him, because he’ll only get in the way.",0,0
46,进入基地后，叶文洁主要在发射部工作，随着时间的推移，对她的限制渐渐放松，那名时刻陪着她的监视人员也取消了，她可以接触红岸系统的大部分结构，也可以阅读相应的技术资料。,"
Over time, as Ye continued to work at the Transmission Department, the restrictions on her were gradually relaxed, and even the security guard assigned to watch her was called off. She was allowed to touch most components of Red Coast’s systems, and could read the relevant technical documents.",1,1
47,叶文洁恍然大悟。红岸系统虽然只是一台电波发射机，但并不等于它就是个寻常之物，最令她吃惊的是它的发射功率，竟然高达二十五兆瓦！这不仅远大于所有的通讯发射功率，也大于所有的雷达发射功率。,"Ye finally understood. Even though Red Coast was only a radio transmitter, that didn’t mean it was conventional. The most surprising aspect was its transmission power: as high as twenty-five megawatts! This wasn’t just more powerful than all communication transmissions, but also all radar transmissions. ",1,1

53,她转身一看，是杨卫宁，他盯着雷政委，目光很严厉。,"She turned and saw that it was Yang Weining, who stared at Commissar Lei severely.",-1,-1
54,“是他把我带进基地的，可到现在他还是不信任我。”叶文洁悲哀地想,"He’s the one who brought me here, but he still doesn’t trust me, a disconsolate Ye thought.",-1,-1
55,雷志成是叶文洁心目中真正的军人，有着军人的坦诚和直率,"Lei was closer to her image of a real military officer, possessing a soldier’s frank and forthright manners.",1,1
56,而杨卫宁只是一个她见过很多的这个时代典型的知识分子，胆小谨慎，只求自保平安。,"Yang, on the other hand, was nothing more than a typical intellectual of the period: cautious, timid, seeking only to protect himself.",-1,-1
57,但监听部的技术水平比发射部要先进一个层次。,the technology level of the Monitoring Department was far more advanced.,1,1

60,但你来了后，在技术上表现出了很强的工作能力，所以我们决定让你承担更多、更重要的工作。,"But after you came, you showed very strong abilities, so we decided to give you more responsibilities.",1,1
61,从那名军官的语气和神色中，叶文洁感到了不祥,"From the officer’s tone and expression, Ye knew that something had gone wrong.

62,但这又意味着叶文洁走出雷达峰的最后一线希望也将不复存在，红岸基地将是她一生最终的归宿。," However, this choice would extinguish the last ray of hope she had of ever leaving Radar Peak. Once she said yes, she really would spend the rest of her life at Red Coast Base.

65,以前天真的理想主义愿望破灭了,"Na?ve, idealistic hopes had been shattered. ",-1,-1
66,学者们发现，与大多数人美好的愿望相反，人类不可能作为一个整体与外星文明接触，这种接触对人类文化产生的效应不是融合而是割裂，对人类不同文明间的冲突不是消解而是加剧,"Scholars found that, contrary to the happy wishes of most people, it was not a good idea for the human race as a whole to make contact with extraterrestrials. The impact of such contact on human society would be divisive rather than uniting, and would exacerbate rather than mitigate the conflicts between different cultures.",-1,-1
67,"目前的地球文明只能大致定为0.7型——连Ⅰ型都未达到，而红岸的发射功率又仅仅是地球能调集的输出功率的千万分之一，这一声呼唤，就像万里长空中的一只蚊子在嗡嗡叫，不会有谁听见的！”
","Civilization on Earth is currently about a Type 0.7, not even a full Type I. And the transmissions from Red Coast used only about one ten-millionth of the amount of power the Earth could muster. Our call was like the buzzing of a mosquito in the sky. No one could hear it.”",0,0

70,叶文洁的双眼盈满了泪水，透过眼泪，屏幕上的代码变成了一团团跳动的火焰。自父亲死后，这是她第一次流泪。,"Ye’s eyes were filled with tears. Seen through them, the code on the screen became flickering flames. This was the first time she had cried since the death of her father.",-1,-1

75,其实很简单：太阳的运行之所以没有规律，是因为我们的世界中有三颗太阳，它们在相互引力的作用下，做着无法预测的三体运动。,It’s actually pretty simple. The reason why the sun’s motion seems patternless is because our world has three suns.,0,0
76,它们在相互引力的作用下，做着无法预测的三体运动。当我们的行星围绕着其中的一颗太阳做稳定运行时，就是恒纪元,"Under the influence of their mutually perturbing gravitational attraction, their movements are unpredictable—the three-body problem. When our planet revolves around one of the suns in a stable orbit, that’s a Stable Era.",0,0
77,当另外一颗或两颗太阳运行到一定距离内，其引力会将行星从它围绕的太阳边夺走，使其在三颗太阳的引力范围内游移不定时，就是乱纪元；一段不确定的时间后，我们的行星再次被某一颗太阳捕获，暂时建立稳定的轨道，恒纪元就又开始了。,"When one or more of the other suns move within a certain distance, their gravitational pull will snatch the planet away from the sun it’s orbiting, causing it to wander unstably through the gravitational fields of the three suns.

95,逃脱这种命运的唯一途径是与一名异性结合。这时，构成他们身体的有机物质将融为一体，其中三分之二的物质将成为生化反应的能源，使剩下的三分之一细胞完成彻底的更新，生成一个全新的躯体；之后这个躯体将发生分裂，裂解为三至五个新的幼小生命，这就是他们的孩子，他们将继承父母的部分记忆，成为他们生命的延续，重新开始新的人生。,"The only way to escape this fate was to mate with a member of the opposite sex. When that happened, the organic material making up their bodies would meld into one. Two-thirds of the material would then become fuel to power the biochemical reaction that would completely renew the cells in the remaining one-third and create a new body. Then this body would divide into three to five tiny new lives: their children. They would inherit some of the memories of their parents, continue their lives, and begin the cycle of life anew. ",0,0
96,但以监听员卑微的社会地位，孤独封闭的工作环境，又到了这个年纪，能有哪个异性看得上自己呢？,"But given the listener’s low social position, lonely and enclosed workspace, and advanced age, what member of the opposite sex would be interested in him?",-1,-1
97,过滤嘴中的海绵或活性炭是三维体，它们的吸附面则是二维的，由此可见，一个微小的高维结构可以存储何等巨量的低维结构。,"“The sponge or active charcoal inside a filter is three-dimensional. Their adsorbent surfaces, however, are two-dimensional. Thus, you can see how a tiny high-dimensional structure can contain a huge low-dimensional structure. ”",0,0
98,但在宏观世界，高维空间对低维空间的容纳也就到此为止了，因为上帝很吝啬，在创世大爆炸中只给了宏观宇宙三个维度。,"But at the macroscopic level, this is about the limit of the ability for high-dimensional space to contain low-dimensional space. Because God was stingy, during the big bang He only provided the macroscopic world with three spatial dimensions, plus the dimension of time.",-1,-1
99,但这不等于更高的维度不存在，有多达八个维度被禁锢在微观中，加上宏观的三维，在基本粒子中，存在着十一维的空间。," But this doesn’t mean that higher dimensions don’t exist.

110,突变型：基础理论成果被迅速转化为实用技术，产生技术突变。最近的例子是核武器的出现，直到四十年代，还有一部分最优秀的物理学家认为释放原子能是永远不可能的事，但核武器在极短的时间内突然出现，基础科学向应用技术的转化跨度极大，时间极短，我们定义为技术突变。,"Saltatory mode: theoretical, fundamental results rapidly become applied technology, leading to a technological leap. Recent examples include the appearance of atomic weapons. Until the forties, some of the foremost physicists still thought it would never be possible to release the energy of the atom. But atomic weapons then appeared within a very short period.

111,监听员知道，在宇宙尺度上，对于来自太空的低频电波，因为没有足够长的测量基线，只能确定发射源的方向，却无法知道其距离；在那个方向上，可能是远距离的高功率发射源，也可能是近距离的低功率发射源；那个方向有亿万颗恒星，每一颗都以远近不同的星星汇成的星海为背景，不知道发射源的距离，根本不可能确定位置坐标。,"The listener knew that at the scale of the universe, due to the lack of a sufficiently long measurement baseline, it was impossible to determine the distance of a source of low-frequency radio transmission from space, only the direction. The source could be high-powered but far away, or low-powered but close by. In that direction were billions of stars, each shining against a sea of other stars at different distances. Without knowing how far away the source was, it was impossible to ascertain its exact coordinates.",0,0
112,伊文斯高举一只拳头，对着人群喊道：“消灭人类暴政！”,"Evans raised a fist and shouted at the crowd, “Eliminate human tyranny!”",1,1
113,叶文洁：确实如此。由大型宇宙飞船组成的三体星际舰队质量巨大，加速十分缓慢，十分之一光速只是它们能够达到的最高速度，在这个速度上只能巡航很短的时间，就要开始减速。,"YE: Here’s the thing. The Trisolaran Interstellar Fleet is composed of incredibly massive spaceships. Accelerating them is a slow process. One-tenth the speed of light is only their maximum speed, but they cannot cruise at this speed for long before decelerating as they approach the Earth. ",0,0
114,另外，三体飞船推进的动力是正反物质的湮灭，飞船前方有一个巨大的磁力场，形成一个漏斗形的磁罩，用于收集太空中的反物质粒子，这种收集过程十分缓慢，经过相当长的时间，才能得到供飞船进行一段时间加速的反物质数量，因此舰队的加速是间断进行的，很长时间的收集后才能进行一次。,"Also, the source of propulsion for the Trisolaran ships is matter-antimatter annihilation. In front of each ship is a large magnetic field shaped like a funnel to collect antimatter particles from space. This collection process is slow, and only after a long wait can it gather enough antimatter to allow the ship to accelerate for a brief period. Thus, the fleet’s acceleration occurs in spurts, interspersed by long periods of coasting to collect fuel.",0,0

118,她就这样慈祥地走到墙角，那里放着一桶盥洗用的水，她提起桶，把里面的水一半泼到叶文洁的身上，一半倒在被褥上，动作中有一种有条不紊的沉稳，然后扔下桶转身走出门，扔下了一句怒骂：“顽固的小杂种！”,"till appearing kind and affectionate, she walked to the corner of the cell, where there was a bucket for washing.

At each moment, the spheres’ motion vectors can combine in infinite ways. I treat each combination like a life form. The key is to set up some rules: which combinations of motion vectors are “healthy” and “beneficial,” and which combinations are “detrimental” and “harmful.” ",0,0

127,一股浓烟从破洞中涌出，在右岸直线航行了一段的“审判日”号就拖着这道烟尾开始转向，很快越过河面，撞到左岸上。汪淼看到，冲上岸坡的巨大船首在急剧变形的同时，将土坡像水一样冲开，激起汹涌的土浪。,"A thick column of smoke poured out of the hole. Judgment Day, which had been sailing along the right shore, now began to turn, dragging this smoky tail. Soon it crossed over the canal and smashed into the left shore.

137,对主而言，这只是一项很小的发明，但对地球人类却意义重大。地球人类可以凭借这项技术轻易地进入近地空间，在太空建立起大规模的防御体系便成为可能。所以，必须扑灭这项技术。,"For our Lord, this is but a tiny invention; but for humans on Earth, its meaning would be significant. With this technology, humans could easily enter near-Earth space and build up large-scale defensive structures. Thus, this technology must be extinguished.",1,1
138,作为天体物理学家，叶文洁对核武器十分敏感，她知道这是恒星才具有的力量。她更清楚，宇宙中还有更可怕的力量，有黑洞，有反物质，等等，与那些力量相比，热核炸弹不过是一支温柔的蜡烛。如果人类得到了那些力量中的一种，世界可能在瞬间被汽化，在疯狂面前，理智是软弱无力的。,"As an astrophysicist, Ye was strongly against nuclear weapons. She knew this was a power that should belong only to the stars. She knew also that the universe had even more terrible forces: black holes, antimatter, and more. Compared to those forces, a thermonuclear bomb was nothing but a tiny candle. If humans obtained mastery over one of those other forces, the world might be vaporized in a moment.

430,知道你还活着我很高兴！,I’m glad to know you’re still alive.,1,1
431,太空中充满了碎片，形成了一团直径达十万公里、仍在迅速膨胀的金属云，云中战舰爆炸的核火球把云团苍白的轮廓一次次显现出来，像宇宙暗夜中时隐时现的一张阴沉的巨脸。,"Space was chock-full of debris in a cluster ten thousand kilometers in diameter, a rapidly expanding metallic cloud whose edges were illuminated time and again by the nuclear fireballs of exploding warships, as if a giant, stony face were flickering in and out of the cosmic night.",0,0
432,从长长的睡眠中醒来，章北海一看时间，居然睡了十五个小时，这可能是他除了长达两个世纪的冬眠外睡得最长的一觉了。,"Awakening from a long sleep, Zhang Beihai looked at the time: He had been asleep fifteen hours, perhaps the longest he had ever slept apart from his two centuries in hibernation.",0,0
433,刚刚复活的意识在努力分辨着，最初看清的是几根横空而过的透明细管，然后是管道后面的一张俯视着的人脸，人脸很快消失，露出发着乳白色光芒的天花板。,"The newly resurrected consciousness struggled to make sense of it, at first managing to work out a few thin, transparent tubes, then a human face behind them, which quickly disappeared, exposing the creamy-white light of the ceiling.",0,0
434,当机械臂的六指夹具最后夹紧了水滴时，舰队百万人的心脏同时悸动了一下，三小时后这同样的悸动将在地球上的三十亿颗心脏上出现。,"When the robot arm’s six digits grasped hold of the droplet at last, a million hearts in the fleet beat as one, echoed three hours later by three billion hearts on Earth.",1,1
435,这里已是旧城边缘，过去的高层建筑群在远方出现，黑乎乎地立在夜雨中，每幢建筑上只零星地亮着几点灯火，像一只只孤独的眼睛。,"The old high-rises of the past were visible in the distance, standing black in the rainy night, each building’s few scattered lights looking like lonely eyes.",0,0
436,他转身走的时候，白大褂上出现了翻滚的乌云，护士的衣服上则映出了许多双大眼睛，有的目光惊惧，有的含着泪。,"As he turned to leave, his white coat displayed billowing dark clouds, and the nurse’s uniform displayed lots of pairs of eyes, some of them frightened, some brimming with tears.",-1,-1
437,这是一个失望和希望来得一样快的时代，在焦虑地等待了一年半后，公众终于对面壁者罗辑失去了耐心和信心。,"It was an age in which hope came as quickly as disappointment, and after anxiously waiting for a year and a half, the public lost faith and patience in Luo Ji the Wallfacer.",-1,-1
438,阳光计划来自一个联合国提案，其主旨是：人类一旦取得末日之战的胜利，就应该在太阳系为战败的三体文明提供生存空间。,"Project Sunshine was a UN proposal whose main thrust was that, in the event of a human victory in the Doomsday Battle, defeated Trisolarans ought to be provided with space in the Solar System.",0,0
439,太阳已经从东方露出一角，把金辉洒向这个从毁灭中幸存的世界。,"A corner of the sun was peeking out in the east, casting gold across a world that had survived destruction.",1,1
440,不远处有几辆坠毁的飞车残骸，在一辆正在燃烧的残骸旁边围了一圈人，不断地把从草坪上拾到的其他可燃物扔进火里，有人还把自己闪亮着图像的衣服扔了进去。,"Not far off was the wreckage of several crashed flying cars, one of which was in flames and surrounded by a crowd of people who were picking up other combustibles from the lawn and throwing them into the flames.",0,0
441,当舰队毁灭的影像从二十个天文单位外经过三小时传回地球时，公众的表现就像一群绝望的孩子，世界变成了被噩梦缠绕的幼儿园,"When the images of the fleet’s destruction twenty AU away reached Earth after a three-hour delay, the public behaved like a gang of desperate children, turning the world into a nightmare-plagued kindergarten.",-1,-1
442,他看到，自己所在的位置处于一个由两千颗耀眼的小太阳构成的大平面上，它们的光芒使他的满头白发像燃烧起来似的。,"What he saw was that he was situated on a large plane consisting of two thousand small, dazzling suns whose light seemed to set his gray hair aflame.",0,0
443,全面启动雪地计划将导致整个太空经济的停滞，因而也会带来地球和舰队经济的全面衰退，两个国际都不愿为此计划付出这样的代价。,A full launch of the Snow Project would bring the entire space economy to a standstill and lead to a general economic recession on Earth and in the fleet.,0,0
444,从亚洲舰队基地看去，那颗小太阳渐渐缩小，变成一颗明亮的星星，但在以后长达一个星期的时间里，这颗星星仍依稀可见，在群星中隐现着亚洲舰队无尽的伤痛。,"Seen from the Asian Fleet base, the small sun gradually shrank, turning into a bright star that remained faintly visible for a week, as a reminder from the stars of the lasting pain of the Asian Fleet.",-1,-1

450,你比谁都清楚，在可以想见的未来，人类的技术根本不可能实现这个目标，因为你是大脑量子机制的发现者，知道对思维的研究必然进入量子层次，在基础物理学被智子锁死的情况下，这种研究是无源之水，不可能取得成功。,"You more than anyone are aware that it is utterly impossible for human technology to accomplish this in the foreseeable future, because you were the one who discovered the quantum structure of the brain.",-1,-1
451,最后看了一眼这间自己已经待了一个多月的球形舱室后，章北海打开舱门，飘了出去，他已经准备好平静地面对狂怒的人群，面对无数谴责和鄙夷的目光，面对最后的审判……面对自己不知道还有多长的余生，作为一名已经尽责的军人，不管将遇到什么，这余生肯定是平静的。,"Taking a last look at the spherical cabin in which he had spent more than a month, he opened the door and drifted out, prepared to calmly face the fury of the crowd, to face the countless expressions of disdain and condemnation, to face the final judgment … and to face, as a conscientious soldier, a life whose duration he did not know.",-1,-1
452,朝阳照进了城市，被巨树分隔成一缕缕光柱，给空中的车流镀上了一层金辉。,"The rising sun shone onto the city and was cut into shafts of light by the trees, coating the traffic with a layer of gold.",0,0
453,尾迹最初像一颗怒发冲冠的彗星，但很快拉长，变成一条上万公里长的银光巨龙。,"First it resembled a comet bristling with rage, but as the tail lengthened, it turned into a huge silver dragon that stretched ten thousand kilometers.",0,0
454,而最令人们激动的还不是眼前的事实，而是已经现出雏形的光明未来：三体文明的技术与人类的力量相结合，将使太阳系变成怎样一个梦幻天堂？,"But what excited people most of all was not the facts before their eyes, but the rudimentary outline of a bright future: What sort of fantastic paradise would the Solar System become after the union of Trisolaran technology and human power?",1,1
455,他移动于其中，有一种从未体会过的宁静和舒适。,He moved through it with a sense of tranquility and comfort he had never known before.,1,1
456,这时，舰队的指挥官们都处于一种震颤麻木状态中，在过去长达两个世纪的太空战略和战术研究中，设想过各种极端的战场情况，但目睹一百艘战舰像一挂鞭炮似的在一分钟内炸完，还是超出了他们的心理承受能力。,"For nearly two centuries, research into space strategy and tactics had dreamed up every possible kind of extreme battle condition, but witnessing a hundred warships blowing up like a string of firecrackers in under a minute was beyond what their minds could comprehend.",-1,-1
457,水滴看上去是那么脆弱，像太空中的一只暖瓶胆，所有人都担心它会在钢爪下破碎。,"The droplet looked so fragile, like a glass thermos liner in space, that everyone was afraid it would shatter in the claw.",0,0
458,在他们的上方，树形建筑遮天蔽日，天空的缝隙中穿行着飞车的车流，但由于城市建筑都是悬在空中的“树叶”，地面的空间十分宽阔，只有间距很远的巨树树干，使得城市已经没有了街道的概念，只是一片其间坐落着树干的连绵的广场。,"Because the buildings were “leaves” hanging in the air, the ground was wide open, and the widely spaced trunks of the giant trees meant there was no sense of streets, just a rolling plaza dotted with tree trunks.",0,0
459,在外太空中搜寻和跟踪这样小的不发光物体是很难的，现在我们失去了它们的踪迹，我们无法判断它们到达太阳系的时间，甚至它们到达后我们都无法觉察到。”,"Locating and tracking such small, dark bodies in outer space is incredibly difficult, and now that we’ve lost their tracks, we don’t know when they’ll reach the Solar System.",-1,-1
460,眼睛适应了之后，主任看到这里像一个吸毒者的地下室，地上到处散落着酒瓶和烟头，成堆的脏衣服上落满了烟灰，像一个垃圾堆。,"Once the director’s eyes had adapted, she saw that the place looked like the basement of a drug addict, the floor littered with bottles and cigarette ends, the piles of clothes covered in ash like a garbage heap.",-1,-1
461,人们也在展望这个世界的走向，期待星舰地球成为未来文明雪球的一个内核，随着舰队到达一个又一个的行星系，这个雪球会不断扩大。,"People acknowledged their prospects and looked forward to Starship Earth forming a core that would snowball into a future civilization, continually increasing in size as the fleet reached star system after star system.",1,1
462,在这惨烈的毁灭中，直线排列的战舰队列就像一根被点燃的长达两千公里的导火索，在剧烈的燃烧后，留下一条发着暗红色余光的灰烬带。,"In this brutal destruction, the lined-up warships were like a two-thousand-kilometer fuse that burned with such intensity that it left behind nothing but ash glowing a dull, dark red.",-1,-1
463,不过我真的看到了自己想看的未来，我感到很幸福。,"However, I have seen the future I hoped to see, and for this I am happy.",1,1
464,当车拐下高速公路时，他们面前展现出一幅壮观的奇异景象：新生活五村与公路间的沙漠变成了一张璀璨的光毯，密密麻麻地闪烁着，仿佛是萤火虫的海洋。,"When the car turned off the highway, a strange and spectacular sight met them: The desert between New Life Village #2 and the highway had been turned into a shining blanket dense with lights, like an ocean of fireflies.",0,0
465,"“如果是作为您的爱妻和孩子苏醒的条件呢？”
“这么卑鄙的话你居然也能在这里说出来。”","“And if it were a condition for reawakening your wife and child?”

“That’s a despicable thing to say at a time like this.”",-1,-1
466,水滴被击中时发光的亮度甚至使周围的核火球也变得黯淡，所有监视系统都为避免光学部分被强光损坏而调暗了图像，肉眼直视水滴会造成长时间的失明。,"The light emitted from the droplet when it was struck was so bright it drowned out the nuclear fireballs going off all around it, forced the monitoring systems to dim their images to avoid damage to their optical components, and caused sustained blindness to anyone who looked directly at it.",0,0
467,而人类技术所能加工的最光滑的表面，只放大上千倍后其粗糙就暴露无遗，正像格利弗眼中的巨人美女的脸。,"The smoothest surface that human technology could produce revealed itself as rough at just one thousand times magnification, like Gulliver’s impression of the face of the beautiful giantess.",-1,-1
468,是的，在这寒冷广漠的宇宙中，同为碳基生命本身就是一种缘分，一种可能要几十亿年才能修得的缘分，这个缘分让人们感受到一种跨越时空的爱。,"Yes, in the cold expanse of the universe, all carbon-based life shared a common destiny, one that might take billions of years to cultivate, but a destiny that cultivated feelings of love that transcended time and space.",1,1
469,一年又一年过去，终于到了那一天，当你第一次苏醒后，穿过大脑神经网络的图像走到我身边时，我再次看到你的眼睛，终于领悟了。,"The years passed, until finally, when you had just awakened and walked through the neural-network cloud to my side, and I looked into your eyes, I finally understood.",1,1
470,当时，他只身站在舰尾的平台上，平台在一个透明球形罩内，使得这里像暴露在太空中一样。,"He had been standing on the aft platform at the time, a platform enclosed in a transparent dome that made it seem exposed to space.",0,0
471,白色的球形舱壁像蜡一样消融了，“自然选择”号本身也消失了，他们悬浮在无际的太空中。,"The bulkheads of the white sphere melted like wax and Natural Selection vanished, leaving them suspended in infinite space, facing the misty starfield of the Milky Way.",0,0
472,五分钟过去了，对于重置口令的操作，这时间显然太长了，而即将成为舰长的章北海，是培训后的特遣队成员中对战舰指挥系统操作最熟练的人。,"Five minutes passed, clearly too long for changing a password, especially since Captain-in-waiting Zhang Beihai had come through training as the most skilled command system operator out of all the members of his Special Contingent.",-1,-1
473,现在，水滴使他们感受到了这种爱，任何敌意的鸿沟都是可以在这种爱中消弭的。,"And now, they sensed that love in the droplet, a love that could bridge the chasm of any enmity.",1,1
474,有许多行人围拢过来，他们的服装都映出表现惊恐的图像，闪成一片。,"Lots of pedestrians crowded round, the scenes of terror on their clothing flashing as one.",-1,-1
475,罗辑说：“我必须走了，否则这座城市真的要毁灭了。”,"Luo Ji said, “I have to leave, or else the city will really be destroyed.”",-1,-1
476,看到这一幕，冬眠者们又开始向讲坛上扔黄瓜土豆什么的，使得这一次小小的冲突最终在双方共同的欢乐中结束。,"When the hibernators saw this, they began tossing cucumbers and potatoes onto the stage as well, and thus the minor confrontation was resolved in mutual merriment.",1,1
477,外面，昨天还能看到的星星又消失了，黑乎乎的沙漠和夜空在地平线处连为一体，只有前面的一段公路在车灯的照耀下延伸。,"Outside, the stars that were visible yesterday had vanished, and the black desert and night sky joined into one at the horizon.",0,0
478,在火球出现的间隙，金属岩浆的光芒则使云团变成如血的晚霞。,"In between the fireballs, the glow of metallic magma turned the cloud into a blood-red sunset.",0,0
479,不过话说回来，虽然到处是沙漠，现在这个世界还是让我想起了江南，这个时代，美女如水啊。”,"Still, even though the desert’s everywhere, today’s world still reminds me of the south, and the age in which the women were as graceful as the water.”",1,1
480,它那黯淡的光亮好似山谷中的烛光，在残骸黑暗的高崖上投下一小圈光晕，那片被照亮的钛合金壁上镌刻着所有死难者的名字，没有墓志铭。,"Its dim light was like a candle in the mountain valley, casting a small halo onto a high cliff of the wreckage and shining on a piece of titanium bulkhead engraved with the names of the victims.",-1,-1
481,当与人群的距离进一步缩短时，他终于还是站住了，因为他看清了人们衣服上的图像。,"When he had gotten closer to the crowd, he finally stopped, because he saw the images they had on their clothes.",0,0
482,给岁月以文明，给时光以生命。,"Make time for civilization, make time for life.",0,0
483,罗辑被他们的目光所慑服，他知道，普通人的目光，是他们所在地区和时代的文明程度的最好反映。,"He was won over by their expressions, because he knew that the eyes of ordinary people were the best reflection of the level of civilization in a time and place.",1,1
484,他的衣服上映着一幅很古典的《圣经》画面：赤裸的亚当和夏娃站在伊甸园的树下，一条妖艳的毒蛇在他们之间蠕动着，不知是不是象征着刚刚发生的黑暗战役。,His clothing showed a classical biblical scene: a naked Adam and Eve standing beneath a tree in the Garden of Eden as a bewitching snake crawled between them.,0,0
485,章北海又摇摇头，“正像前面那些公民所说，星舰地球航行在严酷的太空中，威胁整个世界的灾难随时都可能发生。,"“Like those citizens said before, Starship Earth is traveling through the harsh environment of space, where catastrophes that threaten the entire world might occur at any time.",-1,-1
486,司令官话中的“我们”和“传统”这两个词让章北海有一种温暖的感觉，他知道，两个世纪前那支军队的血脉仍在太空舰队中延续。,"The commander’s use of “our” and “tradition” warmed Zhang Beihai, letting him know that the bloodline of the military of two centuries ago still endured in the space fleet of today.",1,1
487,“但我还是不知道，你如何通过对人类大脑和思维的研究来实现这个目标，甚至在思想钢印出现后，我仍然处于迷惑之中。,“But I still didn’t know how you would achieve this goal through your research into the brain and thoughts.,-1,-1

489,当三双眼睛再次互相对视时，目光又变得飘忽不定了，像三点在风中摇曳的烛火。,"When the three pairs of eyes met once again, they were uncertain and erratic, like candles flickering in the wind.",-1,-1
490,整个金属云团都映照着巨龙发出的光芒，它在云中上下翻飞，仿佛沉浸在自己疯狂的舞动中。,The entire metallic cloud glowed with the dragon’s light as it whipped to and fro in its mad dance.,0,0
491,我只是想和您讨论一种可能：也许爱的萌芽在宇宙的其他地方也存在，我们应该鼓励她的萌发和成长。,I only wish to discuss with you one possibility: Perhaps seeds of love are present in other places in the universe.,1,1
492,当罗辑和史强走出电梯时，有种怀旧的感觉，产生这种感觉的原因是：出口大厅的墙壁和地板上没有被激活的显示窗口了，各种信息显示在悬挂于天花板上的真正的显示屏上。,"When Luo Ji and Shi Qiang exited the elevator, they felt nostalgic, a feeling prompted by one thing: The walls and floor of the exit hall did not have activated display windows.",0,0
493,这时夕阳已经照到天线下面，罗辑在映像中看到庄颜的长发和白裙在金色的阳光中飘动，像一个从天空俯视地面的天使。,"The setting sun now shone beneath the antenna, and, in the reflection, Luo Ji could see Zhuang Yan’s long hair and white dress fluttering in the golden sunlight like an angel looking down from the sky.",1,1
494,它在所有的可能之外，即使柏拉图的理想国中也没有这样完美的形状，它是比直线更直的线，是比正圆更圆的圆，是梦之海中跃出的一只镜面海豚，是宇宙间所有爱的结晶……美总是和善连在一起的，,"Not even in Plato’s Republic was there such a perfect shape: straighter than the straightest line, more circular than a perfect circle, a mirrored dolphin leaping out of the sea of dreams, a crystallization of all the love in the universe.…",1,1
495,飞来的碎片主要是被核火球烧熔的金属，它们大小不一，在飞行途中已经被太空中的低温部分冷却，但冷却变硬的只是一层外壳，里面还是炽热的液态，被击中后像焰火一样灿烂地飞散。,"These flying fragments, consisting largely of metal melted by the nuclear fireballs, were irregular in size, and although they had been partially cooled in flight by the low temperatures of space, only their outer shells had solidified.",0,0
496,对于被抛弃在无边暗夜中的孩子们，最需要的就是父亲，现在，同东方延绪一样，他们从这名来自古代的军人身上感受到了父亲的力量。,"Children cast aside into the endless night needed a father most of all, and now, like Dongfang Yanxu, they found the power of that father in the person of this ancient soldier.",1,1
497,两个世纪前被三体舰队出发的影像所压抑的人类精神，终于得到了彻底的解放。,The human spirit that had been repressed since the first appearance of the Trisolaran Fleet two centuries ago had finally found total liberation.,1,1
498,是的，我现在认为自己做的都是正确的，我绝对相信这一点，而不管现实是什么。,"Yes, right now I believe all I’ve done is correct.",1,1
499,这些人不时齐声发出兴奋的尖叫，四散开来躲避从巨树上落下来的碎片，然后又聚集起来狂欢。,"From time to time they would scream excitedly in unison and scatter to avoid debris falling from the trees, then they would regroup and continue their revels.",1,1
500,如果他发现了别的生命，不管是不是猎人，不管是天使还是魔鬼，不管是娇嫩的婴儿还是步履蹒跚的老人，也不管是天仙般的少女还是天神般的男孩，能做的只有一件事：开枪消灭之！,"If he finds other life—another hunter, an angel or a demon, a delicate infant or a tottering old man, a fairy or a demigod—there’s only one thing he can do: open fire and eliminate them.",-1,-1
501,医生心不在焉地说。,the doctor asked warily.,-1,-1
502,“太平洋”号飞离后，氢弹爆炸，所形成的小太阳把光和热量疯狂地倾泻到这寒冷的太空深渊中，周围的球体瞬间汽化，油膜气体在氢弹辐射的飓风中迅速扩散，随后在冷却中化为无数微小的颗粒，尘埃云形成了。,"Once Pacific had departed the vicinity, the bomb exploded, forming a small sun whose light and heat surged into the cold abyss of space and instantly vaporized the surrounding spheres.",0,0
503,接着他独自笑了起来，先是无声地笑，然后哈哈大笑，床和他一起发颤，吓得熊文要叫医生。,"Then he began laughing, silently at first, and then in great guffaws, trembling on his bed and frightening Xiong Wen, who wanted to call the doctor.",-1,-1
504,还有电磁炮，每秒钟能发射上百个钢球，每个有足球那么大，出膛速度每秒几十公里，无坚不摧，几分钟就扫平了火星上的一座大山……,"And there are railguns that can fire a hundred iron spheres a second, each the size of a football, at tens of kilometers per second.",0,0
505,大多数人的思想倾向是：星舰地球处于严酷的太空环境中，自身的生态系统又十分脆弱，在这样的条件下生存，必须建立一个纪律严明的社会，必须保证统一行动的意志。,"The inclination of the majority was that because Starship Earth was a highly fragile ecosystem traveling through the harsh environment of space, a disciplined society had to be established to guarantee a unified will to survive under these conditions.",0,0
506,但罗辑被驱逐的真正原因，还是冬眠者们心中对他彻底的失望。,But the real reason for Luo Ji’s expulsion was that he was an utter disappointment to the hibernators.,0,0
507,他打量着东方延绪，目光中充满着父辈的关切，这目光让东方感到从未有过的舒适，因为现在在星舰地球中，很难再见到这样一双没有阴影的眼睛了。,"He looked her up and down, his eyes full of a fatherly concern that gave her an undreamed-of sense of comfort, for it was hard to find a pair of eyes without a shadow on Starship Earth these days.",1,1
508,这时，人们发现了一个奇异的对比：机械臂显然是一个在设计上只重功能的东西，钢骨嶙峋，加上那些外露的液压设备，充满了繁杂的技术秉性和粗陋的工业感；而外形完美，晶莹流畅的固态液滴——水滴，则用精致的唯美消弭了一切功能和技术的内涵，表现出哲学和艺术的轻逸和超脱。,"It was at this point that people noticed a strange contrast: The mechanical arm was obviously designed purely as a functional object, with a rugged steel frame and exposed hydraulics that felt complicatedly technological and crudely industrial.",1,1
509,在他后面的谈话中，白大褂不断配合着他的表情和情绪，显示出不同的赏心悦目的图像，有大海、晚霞和细雨中的树林。,"As he continued speaking, the coat displayed a continuous assortment of delightful images that matched his expressions and emotions: seas, sunsets, and woods in the drizzle.",1,1
510,罗辑竭力保持着大脑的空白状态，他的头皮发紧，感到上方出现了一只覆盖整个天空的巨掌，向他压下来。,"As Luo Ji worked to maintain a blank state in his mind, his scalp tightened, and he felt like an enormous hand had covered the entire sky overhead and was pressing down on him.",-1,-1
511,很快，黑暗的空间中出现了一些扰动，像穿透一切的微风，这是时间流逝的感觉。,"Soon, disturbances appeared in the darkness of space, penetrating everything like a gentle breeze.",0,0
512,它的液滴外形是那么栩栩如生，以至于观察者有时真以为它就是液态的，根本不可能有内部机械结构。,"Its droplet shape was so natural that observers imagined it in a liquid state, one for which an internal structure was impossible.",0,0
513,丁仪不喜欢这种数学上的极端不对称，他这套用于镇静自己的思维体操失败了。,"He didn’t like extreme asymmetry in mathematics, so this attempt to calm himself through mental gymnastics failed.",-1,-1
514,他们中的大部分人开始变得越来越内向，长时间地独处沉思，人际交流急剧减少，他们在各种会议上的发言也越来越少，很多人选择了完全沉默。,"Most of them started to become increasingly introverted, spending long periods alone with their thoughts and sharply reducing their social interactions.",-1,-1

516,看着它，罗辑的心最后一次在痛苦中痉挛，这一次，是为地球上所有的生命。,"Luo Ji’s heart experienced a last spasm of pain as he watched it, this time for all life on Earth.",-1,-1
517,在这之前，面对那看起来已经近在眼前的无比真实的胜利，他终日被思想钢印折磨着，精神几乎被撕裂了。,"Previously, he had been tormented day and night by the mental seal in the face of what seemed like an all-but-certain victory, and he had nearly suffered a mental breakdown.",-1,-1
518,指数是数学中的魔鬼，如果海中有一个肉眼看不到的细菌，半小时分裂一次，只要有足够的养料，几天之内它的后代就能填满地球上所有的海洋。,"If there’s a microscopic bacterium in the ocean that divides once every half hour, its descendants will fill the entire ocean in the space of a few days, so long as there are sufficient nutrients.",0,0
519,面对这美丽的新世界，罗辑泪流满面，新生的感觉渗透了他的每一个细胞。,"Tears streamed down Luo Ji’s face at the sight of this brave new world, and the sensation of newborn life permeated his every cell.",1,1
520,“哦——”罗辑长长地沉吟一声，他眼前许多绚烂的肥皂泡破裂了，现实露出了真面目，他现在知道，就在这个伟大的新时代，智子仍然无处不在地飘荡着，人类的科学仍被锁死着，现有的技术，都不可能越过智子划定的那条线。,"“Oh—” Luo Ji punctuated his thought with an extended sigh as the gorgeous bubbles before his eyes burst to reveal the true face of the world, and he knew that in this great new era, sophons still floated everywhere and human science was still deadlocked.",-1,-1
521,舰队开始加速，但阵列丝毫不乱，这堵太阳的巨墙以雷霆万钧的气势向太空深处庄严推进，向整个宇宙昭示着人类的尊严和不可战胜的力量。,"The fleet accelerated with no disruption to its formation, its huge wall blocking out the sun, and then made a stately advance into space with the force of a thundercloud, declaring to the universe the dignity and invincibility of the human race.",0,0
522,我们真傻，他毕竟是一个两次改变历史的人！,He’s only someone who’s changed history twice!,-1,-1
523,所有的人都在欢呼中热泪盈眶，许多人因激动而号啕大哭，在历史上从来没有这样一个时刻，每个人都为自己是人类的一员而感到如此幸运和自豪。,"Never before in history had there been such a moment, in which every single person felt fortunate and proud to be a member of the human race.",1,1
524,但从心灵的最深处打动罗辑的，是人们目光中的自信，这种阳光般的自信充满了每一双眼睛，显然已经成为新时代人们的精神背景。,The sunny confidence that filled every pair of eyes had evidently become the spiritual backdrop for the people of this new era.,1,1
525,人群散开了，开始散得很慢很不情愿，但渐渐快了起来，一辆又一辆车开上了高速公路，向城市方向开去，还有许多人沿着公路步行，在夜色中像一长串发光的蚁群。,"The crowd began to disperse, slowly and unwillingly at first, but eventually the pace picked up and car after car headed off down the road in the direction of the city.",0,0
526,电磁炮发射的金属弹具有巨大的破坏力，由于其高速所带的巨大动能，每颗金属弹在击中目标时都相当于一颗重磅炸弹，在对行星的地面目标进行连发射击时，很快就能扫平一座山峰。,"The metal shells fired by the railgun possessed enormous destructive power, and the kinetic energy inherent in their high speed meant that every shell that struck the target hit with the force of a bomb.",0,0
527,她轻盈地飞去，小螺旋桨搅动着阳光，远远地飞过两棵巨树之间，变成了一只小小的蜻蜓，有一群群这样的蜻蜓在城市的巨树间飞翔，但最引人注目的还是飞行的车流，像海底植物间川流不息的鱼群。,"She flew gracefully, the small propellers churning the sunlight, until she turned into a tiny dragonfly between two giant trees in the distance.",0,0
528,他曾经看到过一组由欧洲摄影师拍摄的清朝末年的照片，最深的印象就是照片上的人呆滞的目光，在那些照片上，不论是官员还是百姓，眼睛中所透出的只有麻木和愚钝，看不到一点生气。,"He had once seen a set of photos taken by European photographers in the late Qing Dynasty, and his deepest impression had been of the dull expressions of the people in the photographs.",-1,-1
529,“这不邪门儿，”罗辑说，“人性的解放必然带来科学和技术的进步。”,“Emancipation of human nature inevitably brings with it scientific and technological progress.”,0,0
530,那我们还是魔鬼，否则怎么能无端地把别人想成魔鬼？,"Then we’re already devils, or how else could we think of them as devils unprovoked?",-1,-1
531,当时，三体危机刚刚出现，面对这个人类历史上史无前例的毁灭性危机，国际社会陷入了空前的恐惧和绝望中，面壁计划正是在这样的状态下诞生的，它不是理智的选择，而是绝望的挣扎。,"The Trisolar Crisis had just begun, and in the face of a devastating crisis unheard of in human history, the international community had descended to unprecedented levels of fear and despair.",-1,-1
532,军港此时正运行在木星的背阴面，在行星表面发出的磷光和上方木卫二发出的银白色月光中，这钢铁的群山静静沉睡着。,"The naval base had entered nightside orbit around Jupiter, and the steel mountain clusters slept silently under the surface phosphorescence and the silvery moonlight from Europa overhead.",0,0
533,希恩斯也正要起身离去，听到山杉惠子的话，他两腿一软，跌坐回椅子上。,"Hines, who was getting up to leave, felt his legs buckle at Yamasuki’s words, and he sat down in his chair again.",-1,-1
534,地面的环境很好，有大片的草地和真正的树林，空气清新，一眼望去像是美丽的郊野，行人们穿着闪亮的衣服，像发光的蚂蚁般穿行其间。,"The environment was wonderful: The wide swaths of grasses, forests of actual trees, and fresh air all made it look at first glance like beautiful countryside.",0,0
535,过去就像攥在手中的一把干沙，自以为攥得很紧，其实早就从指缝中流光了。,"The past was like a handful of sand you thought you were squeezing tightly, but which had already run out through the cracks between your fingers.",-1,-1
536,这种把现代的喧嚣和拥挤悬在高空，让地面回归自然的城市设计，让罗辑赞叹不已。,Luo Ji was impressed to no end by the urban design that elevated modern noise and crowdedness into the air and let the ground return to nature.,1,1
537,水滴追上并摧毁最后一艘战舰“方舟”号时，距云团已经相当远了，“方舟”号爆炸的火球在太空深处孤独地亮了几秒钟后就熄灭了，像一盏消失在旷野风中的孤灯。,"The final ship to be destroyed, Ark, had traveled a considerable distance from the cloud, so when the fireball of its explosion lit up space for a few seconds before going out, it was like a solitary lamp in the wind of the wilderness.",0,0
538,罗辑突然想起，两个世纪前，他开着那辆雅阁车，带着想象中的爱人，就是沿着这条路出游的，那时华北平原上覆盖着真的雪。,"It suddenly occurred to him that it was along this very stretch of road two centuries ago that he had driven in the Accord with his imaginary lover, when the northern China plain was covered with real snow.",0,0
539,罗辑的眼眶又湿润了，他再次有了那种来到天堂的感觉。,"Luo Ji’s eyes grew moist, and once again he had that feeling of arriving in heaven.",1,1
540,以后又接连召开了几届公民大会，星舰地球的人们沉浸于创造新世界的激情中。,"*

541,孩子的父亲冷冷地说，母亲和孩子看他的眼光也如外面的秋雨般冰凉。,"“Get out,” the child’s father said coldly, as mother and child watched him with expressions as chilly as the autumn rain outside.",-1,-1
542,在长时间的沉默中，两粒火星都熄灭了，没有一丝风，黑暗在寂静中变得如沥青般黏稠，把夜空和沙漠糊成一体。,"There was no wind, and the dark silence turned thick as asphalt, connecting sky and desert into a murky whole.",-1,-1
543,一知道在哪儿，世界就变得像一张地图那么小了，不知道在哪儿，感觉世界才广阔呢。”,"Once we know where we are, then the world becomes as narrow as a map.",0,0
544,这里只是世界的一个小角落，狂欢的中心是在那些地下大城市中，在那里，人们都走出巨树，街道和广场上人山人海，每个人的衣服都调到了最大亮度，构成一片闪耀的光海；天穹上绽放着虚拟的焰火，有时一朵焰火能覆盖整个天空，即使与太阳为伴，仍然显得明亮而绚丽。,"This was just a small corner of the world, and the center of the activity was in the underground cities, where people left their trees and crowded into the streets and plazas, their clothing turned up to maximum brightness to form a glowing sea of light.",0,0
545,他们在走廊上前行了一段，然后穿过一个自动门，罗辑眼前一亮，看到面前有一条狭长的平台向前伸延，清新的空气迎面扑来，他意识到自己已经在外面了。,"Then, after they’d passed through an automatic door, Luo Ji’s eyes lit up as he saw a narrow platform extending into the distance and felt fresh air blowing toward him.",1,1
546,比他想象的还要快，伊甸园冰凉湿滑的毒蛇也爬进了他的意识，他找到了智慧果并吃下了它，心灵中的最后一缕阳光永远消失了，一切没入黑暗之中。,"He found the fruit of knowledge and ate it, and the last rays of sunshine in his soul disappeared forever as everything plunged into darkness.",-1,-1
547,在与罗辑相视的目光中，充满着睿智的生机，以及他在自己的时代很少感受到的真诚、理解和爱意。,"The gazes that crossed his own were full of a vigorous wisdom, and a sincerity, understanding, and love that he had rarely perceived in his own age.",1,1
548,让我进去，我们一起下地狱！”,I’ll go to hell with you!”,-1,-1
549,罗辑坐到沙地上，他的情绪飞快地跌到了谷底。,"Luo Ji sat down on the sand, and his mood crashed rapidly.",-1,-1
550,罗辑向护士所指的远方眺望了好一会儿，大声喊道：“不可能！,"Luo Ji looked for a bit into the distance where she pointed, and then exclaimed, “Impossible!",-1,-1
551,张翔看到病床上的罗辑脸色煞白，嘴唇发紫，在他身上几乎看不到生命的迹象了。,"Zhang Xiang saw Luo Ji lying on the bed with a pale face, purple lips, and practically no signs of life in his body.",-1,-1
552,热核爆炸的火球在被撞击处出现后，迅速扩张，整个舰队都被强光照亮，在黑天鹅绒般的太空背景上凸现出来，银河系的星海黯然失色。,"The fireball of the thermonuclear explosion appeared at the point of impact with the fuel tank and swiftly expanded until it illuminated the entire fleet against the velvety background of space, outshining the Milky Way.",0,0

555,“这绝对不行。”,“It can’t be done.”,-1,-1
556,最令罗辑心动的是他沿途遇到的人们，不论是医生护士，还是其他人，看上去都整洁高雅，走近时，都亲切地向他微笑致意，有的还向他挥挥手。,"But what impressed him most about the people he saw was that everyone—doctors, nurses, and nonstaff alike—appeared clean and elegant, and smiled warmly at him or waved when they approached.",1,1
557,不知过了多长时间，罗辑已完全消失的潜意识又恢复了一些，他有了感觉，是寒冷，这寒冷仿佛是从他的体内发源的，像光芒般扩散出去，冻结了整个世界。,"After a long while, when Luo Ji recovered a little of the consciousness that had totally disappeared, he had sensations of cold, a cold that seemed to emanate from within his body and diffuse outward like light to freeze the entire world.",-1,-1

561,五年前，那个叫哈里斯的年轻工程师在那里工作，看到“刷子”后他哭了起来，后来这人患上严重的抑郁症，几乎成了个废人，于是被中心辞退了，现在也不知流落何方。,"Five years before, the young engineer Harris had started to cry at the sight of the brush, and afterward had suffered from depression so severe that he became practically useless at his job and was let go.",-1,-1
562,现在，人类文明的航船已经孤独地驶到了茫茫的大洋中，举目四望，只有无边无际的险恶波涛，谁也不知道，彼岸是不是真的存在。,"The ship of human civilization floated alone in the vast ocean, surrounded on all sides by endless, sinister waves, and no one knew if there even was an opposite shore.",-1,-1
563,泰勒打定主意，在这人说出第一句话后就赶他走，也许他要说的事对他自己很重要，但对泰勒没有任何意义。,"Tyler made up his mind to send him off as soon as he spoke his first sentence, for even if what the man had to say was important to him, to Tyler it was meaningless.",-1,-1
564,如果水星的坠落引发的连锁反应真的实现，那将是太阳系最壮丽的乐章，可惜人类只能欣赏最初的一个半小节。,"If the chain reaction triggered by Mercury’s fall actually took place, then it would be the most magnificent movement of the entire symphony of the Solar System … although, unfortunately, humanity would only be able to enjoy the first section.",-1,-1
